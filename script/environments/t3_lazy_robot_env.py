'''
    Turtlebot 3 robot environment file
    Mainly based on OpenAI code taken from https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/openai_ros
    Added few fixes, extended documentation

    some thoghts taken from https://github.com/karray/neuroracer/blob/master/neuroracer_gym/src/neuroracer_gym/neuroracer_env.py

    As of now, no camera feed is subscribed to 
    and passed to the training model for processing. 
    The goal was to have a very reasonably lightweight environment

    IMU topic is removed from this implementation for now

        Initializes a new TurtleBot3Env environment.
        TurtleBot3 doesnt use controller_manager, therefore we wont reset the 
        controllers in the standard fashion (at all for now). 

        To check any topic we need to have the simulations running, we need to do two things:
            1) Unpause the simulation: without that the stream of data doesnt flow. This is for simulations
            that are paused for whatever the reason
            2) If the simulation was running already for some reason, we need to reset the controllers.
            This has to do with the fact that some plugins with tf, dont understand the reset of the simulation
            and need to be reseted to work properly.

        The Sensors: The sensors accesible are the ones considered usefull for AI learning.

        Sensor Topic List:
        * /odom : Odometry readings of the Base of the Robot        
        * /scan: Laser Readings

        Actuators Topic List: /cmd_vel
