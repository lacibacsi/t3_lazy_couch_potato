        Training node:
        uses the t3 lazy class (as all trainings) and trains it with the agent set in training_setup.yaml
        Parameters for the training are stored in the agents respective yaml file

        Usage: 
            1. set agent in training_setup.yaml
            2. create an instance of training.py
            3. hope and debug
